## ETHRhythm ##

Listen to the Ethereum memory pool!!! ETHRhythm is an visualization of what's happening on the Ethereum blockchain through musical notes and colours! When a transaction is received by a blockchain, a coloured box appears on the screen and a musical note is played. Depending on the value of the transaction, the box is coloured blue (low) to red (high) and the pitch of the note changes. When the transactions are confirmed, their corresponding boxes disappear from the page, creating a heatmap representation of the memory pool of the current block! Efficient real-time on-chain data stream is available thanks to [dfuse](https://docs.dfuse.io/) through their websocket service!
